# Target-Practice
A target practice game written in Python.

## Overview
Welcome to **Target Practice**, a game where the player does just that, shoots
targets.
I created this project in order to practice and familiarize myself with Python
and Pygame, after creating the Alien Invasion game from *Pyhton Crash Course* 
by Eric Matthes.
